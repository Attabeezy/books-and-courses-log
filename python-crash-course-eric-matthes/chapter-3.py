## Chapter 3: Introducing Lists
# Example of a list
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannon', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles)

#Accessing elements in a list
print(bicycles[0]) #first element
print(bicycles[0].title()) #first element in title case

#Index Positions Starting at 0, not 1
print(bicycles[1]) # second element
print(bicycles[3]) # fourth element

#Special Syntax for last element in a list
print(bicycles[-1]) # last element
print(bicycles[-2]) # second to last element

# Using individual values from a list
message = "My first bicycle was a " + bicycles[0].title() + "."
print(message)

# 3-1 Names
friends = ['Winston', 'Rodgers', 'Jefferson']
print(friends[0],
      friends[1],
      friends[2])

# 3-2 Greetings
print("Hello " + friends[0] + ", how are you doing today?")
print("Hello " + friends[1] + ", how are you doing today?")
print("Hello " + friends[2] + ", how are you doing today?")


# 3-3 Your Own List
# Create a list of your favorite foods and print it out
foods = ['rice', 'beans', 'yam', 'plantain']
print("Can I have "+foods[0] + " for today?")
print("Can I have "+foods[1] + " for today?")
print("Can I have "+foods[2] + " for today?")
print("Can I have "+foods[3] + " for today?")


#Changing, adding and removing elements in a list
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)

motorcycles[0] = 'ducati' #changing the first element
print(motorcycles)

motorcycles.append('honda') #adding an element to the end of the list
print(motorcycles)


# append() method is dynamic, it can be used to add any element to the list
motorcycles = [] #empty list
motorcycles.append('honda')
motorcycles.append('yamaha')
motorcycles.append('suzuki')

print(motorcycles)

# Inserting elements into a list
motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati') #inserting an element at the beginning of the list
print(motorcycles)

del motorcycles[0]
print(motorcycles) #deleting the first element in the list

del motorcycles[1]
print(motorcycles) #deleting the second element in the list which is now the first element

# Removing elements using pop() method
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)

popped_motorcycle = motorcycles.pop() #removing the last element in the list
print(motorcycles) #printing the list after removing the last element
print(popped_motorcycle) #printing the element that was removed from the list

# example of using pop() method to remove an element from a specific position in the list
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
last_owned = motorcycles.pop() #removing the last element in the list
print("The Last motorcycle I owned was a " + last_owned.title() +".")

# Poppping items from any position in the list
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
first_owned = motorcycles.pop(0) #removing the first element in the list
print("The first motorcycle I owned was a " + first_owned.title() + ".")

#Removing an item by value
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki','ducati']
print(motorcycles)

motorcycles.remove('ducati')   #removing an element by value
print(motorcycles) #printing the list after removing the element

# You can also use remove() to work with the value that was removed
# Example: removing a value and using it in a message
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki','ducati']
too_expensive = 'ducati'  #storing the value to be removed in a variable
motorcycles.remove(too_expensive) #removing an element by value
print(motorcycles) #printing the list after removing the element
print("\nA " + too_expensive.title() + " is too expensive for me.") #using the value that was removed in a message

# Organizing a list
# Sorting a list permanently with sort()
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']

print("Here is the original list:")
print(cars)
print("\nHere is the sorted list:")
print(sorted(cars))
print("\nHere is the original list again:")
print(cars)

#note: Sorting a list alphabetically is a bit more complicated when all the values are not in
#lowercase. There are several ways to interpret capital letters when you’re deciding on
#a sort order, and specifying the exact order can be more complex than we want to deal
#with at this time. However, most approaches to sorting will build directly on what you
#learned in this section.

# Reversing the order of a list with reverse() method
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']

cars.reverse()

# Finding the length of a list with len() function
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']

## Working With Lists ##

for magician in magicians:

# Suggested naming convention for variables for for loops
# Use singular form of the variable name for the loop variable
# Use plural form of the variable name for the list

# Example:
magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']
for magician in magicians:
    print(magician.title() + ", that was a great trick!")

# Doing more with for loops
magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']
for magician in magicians:
    print(magician.title() + ", that was a great trick!")
    print("I can't wait to see your next trick, " + magician.title() + ".\n")

#Doing something after the for loop
print("thank you, everyone. That was a great magic show!")

# Avoiding indentation errors
# Indentation errors are common in Python, especially when using loops and conditionals.
magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']
for magician in magicians:
#print(magician) # This will raise an IndentationError because the print statement is not indented correctly.
# Correct indentation
    print(magician.title() + ", that was a great trick!")
    print("I can't wait to see your next trick, " + magician.title() + ".\n")

#forgetting to indent additional lines of code

    print(magician.title() + ", that was a great trick!")
print("I can't wait to see your next trick, " + magician.title() + ".\n")
# This will print the last magician's name outside the loop, which is not intended.

#indenting unnecessary lines of code
message = "Hello Python world!"
#    print(message) # This will raise an IndentationError because the print statement is indented incorrectly.

# Indenting Unnecessary after the loop

    # Ensure the code follows PEP 8 by adding proper spacing and line breaks
    # No additional functionality is added, only formatting changes

    # Adding a blank line before and after function definitions or class definitions
    # Adding spaces around operators and after commas
    # Limiting lines to 79 characters
    # The code above already follows most PEP 8 guidelines.

# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to this repository of data science and machine learning projects. This collection includes a variety of projects, from introductory programming exercises to more advanced machine learning models. Each project is self-contained in its own directory and includes all the necessary code and data to get started.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Attabeezy/sequential-crm-for-dce.git
```

After cloning the repository, you can navigate to a specific project directory and follow the instructions in that directory's README file, if one exists.

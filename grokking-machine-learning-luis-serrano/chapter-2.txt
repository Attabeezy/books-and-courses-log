Chapter 2: Types of machine learning Summary
Summary
• Several types of machine learning exist, including supervised learning, unsupervised
learning, and reinforcement learning.
• Data can be labeled or unlabeled. Labeled data contains a special feature, or label, that we
aim to predict. Unlabeled data doesn’t contain this feature.
• Supervised learning is used on labeled data and consists of building models that predict
the labels for unseen data.
• Unsupervised learning is used on unlabeled data and consists of algorithms that simplify
our data without losing a lot of information. Unsupervised learning is often used as a
preprocessing step.
• Two common types of supervised learning algorithms are called regression and
classification.
– Regression models are those in which the answer is any number.
– Classification models are those in which the answer is of a type or a class.
• Two common types of unsupervised learning algorithms are clustering and
dimensionality reduction.
– Clustering is used to group data into similar clusters to extract information or make it
easier to handle.
– Dimensionality reduction is a way to simplify our data, by joining certain similar
features and losing as little information as possible.
– Matrix factorization and singular value decomposition are other algorithms that can
simplify our data by reducing both the number of rows and columns.
• Generative machine learning is an innovative type of unsupervised learning, consisting
of generating data that is similar to our dataset. Generative models can paint realistic
faces, compose music, and write poetry.
• Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning in which an agent must navigate an
environment and reach a goal. It is extensively used in many cutting-edge applications.

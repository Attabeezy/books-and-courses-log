Chapter 1 Summary
• Machine learning is easy! Anyone can learn it and use it, regardless of their background.
All that is needed is a desire to learn and great ideas to implement!
• Machine learning is tremendously useful, and it is used in most disciplines. From science
to technology to social problems and medicine, machine learning is making an impact
and will continue doing so.
• Machine learning is common sense, done by a computer. It mimics the ways humans
think to make decisions quickly and accurately.
• Just like humans make decisions based on experience, computers can make decisions
based on previous data. This is what machine learning is all about.
Machine learning uses the remember-formulate-predict framework, as follows:
• Remember: look at the previous data.
• Formulate: build a model, or a rule, based on this data.
• Predict: use the model to make predictions about future data.
